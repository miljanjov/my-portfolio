          I began my career as a sales in the automotive parts retail industry,
          where I've been working for the last 9 years. This job taught me how
          to communicate with people of different personalities and how
          important it is to quickly respond to clients' requests, because the
          market is dynamic and ruthless. Over the years, we were introduced to
          bunch of different softwares that were supposed to make our job
          easier, but those tools were very often hard to learn and use, with
          minimal documentation available. So, I spent more and more time
          looking into issues and wondering why it's so hard to develop
          something that looks so easy to me? I started to be curious how that
          actually works and reachout to some of my friends who were developers.
          And that's where my programming journey started...

          During the last couple of months, I went firstly through the process
          of understanding basic terminology, what is that developers actually
          do, to some basic technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript. My first
          learning path started with series of videos from
          <a href="https://www.danilovesovic.com/">Danilo Vesovic</a>, basics of
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React). I continued with courses of
          <a href="https://codewithmosh.com/">Mosh Hamedani</a>,
          <a href="https://wesbos.com/about">Wes Bos</a>, Kyle Simpson' book
          "You don't know JS".

            <strong>MV-IZOL</strong> is a company that implements hidroisolation solutions in
            Czech Republic for more than ten years. During pandemic period, they
            realised in order to reach more customers they need a website which
            would provide them information about the company and the services
            they're providing. Building a website for <strong>MV-IZOL</strong> was my first
            project and my responsibilities were communicating with the designer
            and frontend development. Website was built using the Gatsby
            framework.
